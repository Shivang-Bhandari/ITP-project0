  <b class="heading">1. How The Web Works :</b>
  <p>
    The web is basically communications of a bunch of computers based on the user inputs.
    When a user searches any domain name or IP address like <a href="www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a>,
    their computer shall send a <em>HTTP Request</em> to the respected <em>Server</em>. The server then
    locates the required HTML page in it's directory and sends the data to the user's computer where a
    <em>Web Browser</em> interprets the data and displays it on the user's system. Udacity has provided users with

  <b class="heading">4. Why Computers are Stupid :</b>
  <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
      literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
      small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
      in a program. they do whatever we make them to do. They just follows the instructions given to them.

  <b class="heading">5. Inline vs Block Elements :</b>
  <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
      elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
      them. some of the inline elements are &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;span&gt; etc.
      Example of block elements are &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;form&gt; etc.
